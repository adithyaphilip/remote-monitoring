Home/Power Plant Remote Monitoring System
________________________________________________
An application for remote monitoring of power plants, diesel generators, and houses.
Works by means of a REST API. Obtains information of utilities being monitored, be it a power station, diesel generator, or fan or light in a household. Users can log in to their accounts, and recharge their subscription (which is handled by means of a POST request with a coupon code to the server).

Features:
* Efficient, effortless monitoring of power plants, diesel generators, and household utilities remotely. Whether your out, stuck in a bus, doesn't matter. Works anytime, anywhere.
* Supports server-side user authentication.
* Shows live server status.
* Customisable to cater to different organisations.
* Very helpful utility for those wishing to implement an Internet-of-Things innovation. Lets you concentrate more on revolutionizing the world with your idea and less on its implementation.
